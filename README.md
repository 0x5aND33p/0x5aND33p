# About Me
My passion for technology started when I was a kid, wondering how  
computers could handle such complex tasks. Fast forward to today,  
I am thrilled to be at a point where I can make a computer follow  
my instructions to solve problems. I am constantly learning and  
experimenting with new technologies, eager to push the boundaries  
of what software and hardware can do.

    My passion for technology started when I was a kid, wondering how computers could handle such complex tasks.
    Fast forward to today, I am thrilled to be at a point where I can make a computer follow my instructions to solve problems.
    I am constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies, eager to push the boundaries of what software and hardware can do.
